Final Project
-------------

This subject includes two projects. In the first, microfluidics platforms are used to study diffusion and osmosis in cells (two or more 3-hour laboratory sessions scheduled at your convenience). In the second project, computer simulation is used to understand neural behaviors. The projects provide an opportunity to learn about (1) planning experiments, (2) acquiring, processing, and interpreting data, (3) communicating the results to others. Both projects require a written proposal, which includes a well-defined hypothesis and procedures to test the hypothesis.

Students are encouraged to work in pairs for both projects. Partners are encouraged to submit a joint proposal and to cooperate in processing data, in discussing interpretations, and in preparing their reports. Partners are also encouraged to submit a joint report. We strongly believe that students learn more by working with other students than by working in isolation.

The report for the first project is written. It should be approximately 10 pages long and structured as a scientific paper. The report for the second project is oral. It should be 12 minutes in length and should be delivered during the next to last week of the semester. The reports for both projects have **firm due dates**, which are listed on the subject calendar. There are **severe lateness penalties** for missing the due dates.
