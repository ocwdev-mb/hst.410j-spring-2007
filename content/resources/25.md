description: After exposure the wafer is placed back on the hot plates for a process
  called a "hard bake". Following that, they are immersed in SU-8 developer. This
  chemical removes the SU-8 that has not polymerized (i.e., has not been exposed to
  UV light). After this step the pattern on the wafer becomes visible.
